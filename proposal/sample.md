# PROJECT TITLE: Smart Inventory Management System (SIMS) for Enhanced Operational Efficiency at TAR UMT Convenience Store

## ABSTRACT

This proposal outlines the development and implementation of a web-based or mobile-friendly Smart Inventory Management System (SIMS) for the on-campus convenience store at Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology (TAR UMT). The primary goal is to replace the current manual, paper-based, or fragmented inventory tracking methods with an automated, real-time digital system. SIMS will address critical issues like frequent stockouts of fast-moving items, overstocking of slow-moving items (especially perishables), data inaccuracy, and time wasted on manual counting and ordering. The system will leverage barcode scanning, real-time sales data integration, and automated low-stock alerts to ensure optimal inventory levels, minimize waste, and ultimately enhance the operational efficiency and profitability of the store, improving the shopping experience for the TAR UMT community.

## PROBLEM

The TAR UMT convenience store faces several critical inventory management challenges common in high-traffic, limited-space retail environments:

1. **Manual Inefficiencies and Errors:** Inventory tracking, stock taking, and re-ordering are predominantly manual, leading to high human error rates, time-consuming processes, and delayed stock updates.

2. **Inaccurate Stock Levels:** A lack of real-time visibility results in frequent discrepancies between physical stock and recorded stock, causing unnecessary emergency orders or, worse, customer dissatisfaction due to stockouts of high-demand campus essentials (e.g., stationery, specific snacks, ready-to-eat meals).

3. **Perishable Goods Waste:** For items like fresh food, drinks, and dairy, poor stock rotation and lack of automated expiry date tracking lead to significant product spoilage and financial loss.

4. **Sub-optimal Ordering:** Ordering decisions are based on historical assumptions rather than accurate, up-to-the-minute sales trends, resulting in overstocking (tying up capital and space) and understocking (lost sales).

## SOLUTION

The Smart Inventory Management System (SIMS) will provide a centralized, digital solution with the following key features:

1. **Point-of-Sale (POS) Integration:** Seamless integration with the existing or a new simple POS system to automatically update inventory levels with every sale in real-time.

2. **Barcode Scanning:** Utilize portable or fixed barcode scanners for fast, accurate receiving (Goods Received Notes) and stock auditing, drastically reducing manual data entry time.

3. **Automated Stock Alerts:** Implement customizable alert thresholds (minimum stock level, re-order point) for key products to trigger automatic notifications for staff when stock is low.

4. **Expiry Date Tracking:** A module to input and track expiration dates upon receiving goods, providing alerts for items nearing their expiry to facilitate timely promotions or markdowns, minimizing spoilage.

5. **Reporting and Analytics:** Generate daily, weekly, and monthly reports on sales performance, stock movement, inventory turnover rate, and shrinkage (loss due to damage/theft).

6. **Supplier Management:** Maintain a digital database of all suppliers, including lead times and pricing, to streamline the Purchase Order (PO) generation process directly from the system.

## TARGET MARKET

The primary target market is the management and operational staff of the on-campus convenience store at TAR UMT, who are directly responsible for purchasing, stocking, and selling goods. The secondary beneficiaries include the TAR UMT students and staff who rely on the store for daily necessities. A more efficient inventory system ensures their most-needed items are always available, improving their overall campus life convenience.

## COMPETITION / CONTRIBUTION

### Competition
The project competes not with a direct rival system in place, but with the status quo-manual or inadequate fragmented inventory methods. Off-the-shelf commercial POS/IMS solutions exist (e.g., solutions from Malaysian vendors like SQL POS, BMO POS), but they can be costly, overly complex for a campus store, and may lack the specific customisation required for TAR UMT's unique environment (e.g., student-worker rotation, specific campus purchasing policies, highly volatile demand due to semester cycles).

### Contribution
SIMS's unique contribution is a custom-fit, affordable, and user-friendly system designed specifically for the needs and constraints of a university campus store. It contributes by:

1. **Financial Benefit:** Reducing losses from spoilage and theft (shrinkage) while increasing sales from reduced stockouts.
2. **Operational Efficiency:** Freeing up staff time from manual tasks to focus on customer service and merchandising.
3. **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Providing management with accurate data to forecast demand, especially during peak periods (e.g., registration week, exam week).
